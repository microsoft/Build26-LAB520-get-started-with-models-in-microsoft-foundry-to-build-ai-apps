# Get Started with Models in Microsoft Foundry: From First Inference to Deployed Agent

> **Duration:** 90-105 minutes | **Level:** Intermediate | **Format:** Code-first, hands-on lab

## Abstract

In this hands-on lab, you will go from zero to a production-ready application using Microsoft Foundry, with no fine-tuning or deep ML expertise required. Starting with the Foundry model catalog, you will provision a project, connect to a hosted model via the OpenAI SDK (through the Azure AI Projects client), and build a complete comment moderation pipeline that classifies user-generated content as safe, needs review, or unsafe. You will compare outputs across models to make informed deployment decisions, then package your moderation logic into a hosted agent running on Foundry's managed infrastructure. By the end of the session, you will have working Python code, a deployed agent accessible via the OpenAI Responses API, and the confidence to integrate production-ready models into your own applications.

## Workshop Overview

Go from zero to a working application by integrating a production-ready model into a real-world **comment moderation** use case using **Microsoft Foundry**, with no fine-tuning or deep ML expertise required.

This is a **code-first lab** where programming experience is key. You will work primarily in the terminal and editor, using SDKs and Foundry APIs to build a functional inference pipeline.

> **Lab Platform:** This lab base has been successfully used with Skillable for Microsoft Build & Microsoft Ignite labs.
